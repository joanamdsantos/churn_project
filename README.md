# Predicting churn app project
Deployment of a churn prediction app

This project is an application to predict churn based on users gender, location and days since registration for a fictional music streaming company Sparkify.

The app accepts csv or xlsx data and returns a csv file with the predictions. The data unseen to be used can be found in the upload folder.

A docker file with the application can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/joanamdsantos/churn-project-app.

I would like to thank Udacity for making this data available.
